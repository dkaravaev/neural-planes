## Why it exists?
This programm was my experiment in Deep Learning technology. 

My task was to solve the detection an classification problem at the same time on aerial objects:

1. Birds (2 types)
2. Army aeroplanes (3 types)
3. Civil aeroplanes (3 types)

Each of these objects was represented on the image with different backgrounds, wich representing 
different weather condidtions.

For solving this problem of was using modified and deeply simplified version of [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) architecture.
